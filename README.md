# ABCD Study Dictionary to ReproSchema Conversion

## Goal of this Repo

This repository converts the ABCD data dictionary from [ABCD Study Dictionary](https://data-dict.abcdstudy.org/) to the [ReproSchema](https://github.com/ReproNim/reproschema) format. This conversion serves reproducibility purposes, allowing tracking the ABCD data dictionary overtime. The repository will be updated every time the ABCD data dictionary changes, with each version appropriately tagged for easy reference. Our conversion does not include the "Imaging" part of the dictionary. The first data dictionary version is not REDCap, later versions will be.

## Structure of this Repo

- `abcd_data_dict_v[version].csv`: CSV file of the ABCD data dictionary downloaded from the [ABCD Study Dictionary website](https://data-dict.abcdstudy.org/)
- `core` folder: The core study of ABCD in ReproSchema format, generated by `abcd2reproschema.py`
- `substudy` folder: The substudy of ABCD in ReproSchema format, generated by `abcd2reproschema.py`
- `abcd2reproschema.py`: The Python script converts the abcd csv into reproschema format.

Both core and substudy are research protocols containing different activities (questionnaires), where each activity has its questions represented as items. For more information on ReproSchema, please read this [documentation](https://www.repronim.org/reproschema/). 

## How to Use/Reproduce this Repo

To reproduce each tagged version, run the following command:

```
python abcd2reproschema.py --file_path abcd_data_dict_v[version].csv --version version
```

For example"

```
python abcd2reproschema.py --file_path abcd_data_dict_v010.csv --version 0.1.0
```

### How to Tag a Version

We did the follow these steps to tag a version:

1. Commit changes to the repository:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Update ABCD data dictionary to version [new_version]"
```

2. Create a new tag for the version:

```
git tag -a v[new_version] -m "ABCD data dictionary version [new_version]"

```

3. Push the tags to the remote repository:

```
git push origin --tags
```
